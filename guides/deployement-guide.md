This document outlines the instructions for deploying our front-end web project.
(This document is to be edited)

- We are using github pages for deployment
- Merge everything and all features into main branch
- Thoroughly check and test main branch
- Remove any dev-testing browser routes
- Check all TODO: comment tags and ensure problems are squashed before deployement
- Then make the commits onto main after fixing these errors
- Make a pull request with deployment (feel free to rebase)
- Pull into deployment
- Load deployment branch locally on ur machine
- Use the ```npm run deploy``` command while on the branch.
- Check the git-hub pages to ensure it was updated
